# MachineLearning

This is the code for my Machine Learning assessments. They were written in Python using Jupyter Notebook, hence the strange formatting.
Assessment 1 Task 1 was to implement Polynomial Regression.
Assessment 1 Task 2 was to implement k-means clustering
Assessment 2 was to develop a Neural Network which would be able to detect whether a given tissue sample was cancerous.
